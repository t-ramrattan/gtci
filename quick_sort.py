  1. Divide and Conquer: Like Merge Sort, Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
  2. In-place (mostly): Unlike Merge Sort, which typically requires O(n) extra space for merging, Quick Sort can often be implemented in-place (or with
     O(log n) auxiliary space for the call stack), making it more memory-efficient.
  3. Performance Comparison: It's important to understand both Quick Sort and Merge Sort as they are two of the most efficient comparison-based sorting
     algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses (e.g., worst-case performance, stability).
  4. Partitioning Strategy: Quick Sort's core idea revolves around a "partitioning" step, which is a fundamental technique used in many other algorithms
     (like finding the k-th smallest element).

  Learning Quick Sort will deepen your understanding of sorting algorithms and introduce you to new techniques.
